            Sometimes it's hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill. Try
            sharing that bill week in, week out and you might encounter more
            than a few snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our
            automated payment system takes care of the rest. You need never talk
            money or who owes what.

        <h2>A framework built for the long term</h2>
        <p>
          Childcare is for the long term. And you need a framework you can count
          on that gives your share long term viability and success. That's why
          we've defined Hapu around our three tribal principles; clearly defined
          process, transparency over money and equality of participation.
